1. Census Definitions

Private dwelling:
Structure equipped for the permanent or temporary lodging of people, with separate and independent access. They can be: fixed or mobile; made of various materials; and house one or more households.

Private Household:
A private household is composed of one or more persons, either related or unrelated, that:
live in the same dwelling
share a single, common budget
eat together, regardless of the ownership or type of kitchen used
recognize a household head among themselves

Household head:

[The following text is in the circle at the upper right of the page]
Remember that to enumerate a person you must enumerate his/her dwelling. In extreme cases, if the person slept on a park bench or under a bridge, this becomes their dwelling.

[p. 6]

How to identify a dwelling and a household

Dwellings are places where one or more households can live. [An arrow points to a picture of such a dwelling.]

When we speak of a household we are speaking of people who:
share the same dwelling [This text is contained within a picture of a house.]
are related or unrelated [This text appears below a picture of 3 people watching TV.]
have a common food budget [This text is below a picture of food, cooking equipment, and the symbol for a single, common budget.]

This is a dwelling where one household lives. [This text appears to the right of a picture of a dwelling filled by a single household, along with the symbol for a single, common budget.]

This symbol [picture of a bag with a "$" on it] indicates a single, common budget.

[p. 7]

How to recognize a private dwelling with two or more households

[p. 8]

Collective Dwelling: A dwelling that houses a collective household

Collective Household: A group of unrelated people that share a dwelling, or part of one, and live communally for reasons of health, work, religion, study, discipline, etc.

A collective household does not have a household head.

[p. 9]

Collective Dwellings (each with a collective household) [An arrow points to three pictures, one of a convent, one of a penitentiary, and one of a hospital.]

A collective household is always enumerated in a collective dwelling, and a private household is always enumerated in a private dwelling. However, if I find a private household living in a collective dwelling (such as the caretaker of a boarding school and his/her family), I must enumerate them on a different questionnaire as a private dwelling and a private household.

B. Dwelling

In this section we will report on where we live, what our dwellings are like, what conditions we live in, if we have basic services, etc. . .

Question 1

"Collective Dwelling": Mark this alternative when, for example, you unexpectedly come across a boarding house (collective dwelling) that doesn't appear on the F1 [The F1 is a census form which indicates the geographic area to be enumerated by each enumerator.]. In this case, you mark it and continue to Sections D and E. [These instructions refer to a graphic of question 1b on the census form.]

Remember that collective dwellings that are recorded on the F1 you do not have to enumerate or record on the summary sheet, because they belong to another area of the census. [These instructions refer to a graphic of question 1b on the census form.]

[p. 28]

For any place that has served as lodging and does not correspond to any of the distinct types of dwelling, you should fill in the oval other type of private dwelling. [These instructions refer to a graphic of question 1a on the census form.]

Question 2

"Dwelling occupied by people who are absent" . . . in this case you should fill in a questionnaire with the number of the dwelling, the address, record it in C2 (or C3) [The C2 is an urban summary sheet for a given census sector and the C3 is a rural summary sheet for a given census sector.], in "Observations" put "pending," and return at the end of the route and, if there is still no one home, leave form C10 [The C10 is a citation.]. [These instructions refer to a graphic of question 2a on the census form.]

If the dwelling is unoccupied, meaning that no one lives there, just as in the previous case, you fill in a questionnaire with the number of the dwelling, you fill in the "unoccupied" oval, and you continue to the next [dwelling], recording in "Observations" on the summary sheet that the dwelling is unoccupied.
