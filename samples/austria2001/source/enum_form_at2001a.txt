General information

We ask that you please handle the Personal Data Form carefully because it will be "read" by an electronic system. For technical reasons, it should be folded only along the perforation and be filled in with a black or blue pen only.

Answer all questions completely and to the best of your knowledge and belief.
Please keep the following points in mind when doing so:

Make every effort to use the style of writing indicated in the sample line on the form when writing the text and numbers.

Place a clearly distinguishable "X" in the applicable boxes.

If there are not enough text boxes for a given entry, simply stop writing at the last box.

If you do not know the exact answer to a given item, it is best to give a rough estimate rather than leave the item out altogether.

Answer questions 4 to 10 based on the situation on 15 May 2001. Questions 11 to 15 refer to the week right before the census date, and only in doubtful cases (e.g. switching to another company) to 15 May 2001.

An "X" should be placed by "Married" for persons living in wedlock (i.e. not divorced) even if they live separately from their spouse.

An "X" should be placed by "Divorced" for persons who are not remarried regardless of whether their former spouse is still living or not.

Question 7:
To show the relationship of household members to families, please put an "X" next to the relationship the person has to the "Head of the household." The person usually contributing the most to household income is to be designated as the head of the household. If income is more or less equal, it is up to the household to designate the person who is to be marked as head of the household.

In households consisting solely of unrelated persons, it is irrelevant to family and household statistics who is marked as the head of the household.

For children who were brought into the marriage or cohabitation, "Daughter/son" should be marked even if the latter are blood children only of the husband (man) or wife (woman).

Question 8:
Please indicate the church or religious denomination to which you belong. If you are not certain whether one of the items corresponds with your religious affiliation, please enter your religious affiliation in the text line.

Gainfully employed persons: Persons over 15 years of age who do paid work at least 1 hour per week or help in a family business without being formally paid are deemed to be gainfully employed.

A person who does just voluntary work is not deemed to be gainfully employed.

Exceptions: Teachers with a full-time teaching position and judges put an "X" next to "gainfully employed full time" even if their work week is less than 32 hours. This is also true of workers in businesses with "short-time working" arrangements (i.e. temporarily reduced working hours).

The unemployed: Persons over 15 years of age who were previously employed and who are seeking work or an apprenticeship position are deemed to be unemployed regardless of whether or not they receive unemployment benefits. Seasonally unemployed persons (e.g. waiters who are without a job between the summer season and the winter season) are deemed to be unemployed unless they pursue other work in the intervening period (in the period around May 15) (e.g. helping out on the family farm).

Persons undergoing practical training, e.g. apprentices, trainees, unpaid interns, pupils being trained for police work and for nursing, are deemed to be fully employed.

Persons undergoing vocational retraining put an "X" next to "gainfully employed full time" if they still hold their position or if they have health insurance through the public employment services agency (AMS) but should answer the questions 12 to 15 for their previous occupation (i.e. not "Public Employment Services Agency").

If you hold several jobs, please answer questions12 to 15 for the occupation involving the most working hours. If you are switching jobs at the time of the census, please answer questions 12 to 15 for your situation on 15 May 2001.

Question 12:
The "self-employed" (also freelances and professionals) are individuals who pursue their profession for their own account and are therefore not in an employment relationship as an employee.

Persons "helping in family business" are gainfully employed persons who are working in a business owned by a family member without receiving formal remuneration for this work.

Persons "under contract for work and services, freelance staff" are individuals who perform their work for their own account, similar to the self-employed.

Question 15:
The information from questions 15.1 to 15.6 on going to work or school everyday can be used to determine traffic flows. If you go both to school and to work, you should answer the questions for going to work.

Re 15.1: Persons commuting once a week enter the address of their accommodations at their place of work/school. If you depart both from your main place of residence and other accommodations, please indicate the place from which you depart more frequently. In case of doubt, the situation on the reference date applies.

Re 15.2: Gainfully employed persons with telework positions who visit their company at least once a week should include commuter data for these trips to the company.

Re 15.4: Gainfully employed persons enter the address of their place of work where they start work everyday. In other words, it is not the address of the head office of the company that is to be entered but e.g. for sales staff the address of the branch and for teachers the address of the school (base school) at which they teach. Persons with variable places of work (e.g. traveling salesmen) are kindly asked to enter the address of the place of work where they receive their work assignment.
