This census, on May 15, 2001, will continue the tradition by providing information needed by community groups, businesses and governments to develop plans for education and training, seniors' housing, day care, fire protection, public transport, and many other programs that are important to all of us.

By law, Statistics Canada must take a census every five years, and every household must fill in a census form. Also, by law, Statistics Canada must protect the confidentiality of the personal information you provide.
