About this guide
This guide contains instructions and examples to help you answer each census question as accurately as possible. Also included are reasons why the questions are asked and how the information you provide will be used.

What is a census?
A census provides a statistical picture of a country and its people. Almost every country in the world conducts a census regularly to collect important social and economic information. In Canada, it is mandatory for people to participate in the census.
In Canada the census is mandated by the Constitution and the Statistics Act.
The Census of Canada is conducted once every five years. The 2001 Census will be held on Tuesday, May 15, 2001.

[p. 3]

Why is the census important?
The results of the census are used to make many important decisions -- decisions affecting your community, your province or territory, and the entire country. Governments, businesses, associations, and community organizations are among the many thousands of census users. Census results benefit all Canadians and are used: to determine the number of seats in Parliament; to decide how much money is transferred from the federal government to your province or territory; to plan pensions, health care, housing and employment programs; to determine where services such as hospitals, roads, schools, day-care centres and public transit are needed.

If you need help
Call the Census help line at 1 800 591-2001 if: you need help completing your questionnaire; you have difficulty answering a question and you need clarification; you do not want your form to be returned to your census representative; you or a member of your household would prefer to fill in a separate questionnaire. This free service is available from May 1 to May 31 between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. TDD/TTY Telecommunication Devices for the Deaf/Teletype Machines only) users should call 1 877 881-8301 (free of charge).

What happens to your census questionnaire?
Census questionnaires will be retained in accordance with legal requirements and stored securely. It takes about six months for your questionnaire to be processed. You can request to see the personal information on your census questionnaire by writing to: Privacy Coordinator, Statistics Canada, R.H. Coats Building, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0T6.

Are census data available free of charge?
Statistics Canada makes every effort to put key census indicators and information in the public domain. Standard census products and publications are made available free of charge in depository libraries and Statistics Canada regional offices. In addition, a wide selection of information from the census such as community profiles are available on the Statistics Canada web site at http://www.statcan.ca.
Custom services and tabulations are offered on a cost-recovery basis to businesses, governments, other organizations and individuals. No identifiable individual information is ever provided in either free or cost-recovery products.

[p. 4]

Does Statistics Canada use census information to conduct other surveys?
From time to time Statistics Canada may use the census results to select households or individuals to participate in other important surveys. This is done only after it can be demonstrated that the census is the most cost efficient and effective means to select the required sample. These uses are strictly for statistical purposes and no one outside Statistics Canada can have access to any identifiable information.

Your role in the census
The information you provide will help ensure that the 2001 Census accurately reflects Canada's changing society. Please complete the questionnaire and "Count yourself in" on Tuesday, May 15, 2001.

Starting off -- Step by step
Step A
We ask for your address to make sure we count every dwelling. We use your telephone number to call you only for information you may have forgotten to include in your questionnaire.

Steps B and C
These steps help you to decide who should be included and who should not be included in the questionnaire. They tell us that we have counted everyone we need to count and that we have not counted anyone twice.

Step D
This step tells us if someone in your household operates a farm. It also ensures that we find all farms for the Census of Agriculture.

Step E
No further instructions.

The questions

Basic population information
Question 1 asks for the name of each person in the household so that no one is left out or counted twice. Names are not put on the census database.
Questions 2 to 6 ask about the people living in the household. From these questions we can learn about living arrangements, family size, the number of children living with one parent or two parents, and the number of people who are alone. This information is used for planning social programs, such as Old Age Security and the Child Tax Benefit. It is also used by towns and cities to plan a variety of services such as day-care centers, schools and senior citizens' homes.
[p. 5]
If you have questions or require further information, please phone the free Census Help Line at 1 800 591-2001.
Question 1 -- Name
Question 2 -- Sex
Question 3 -- Date of birth
Question 4 -- Marital status
Question 5 -- Common-law status
Question 6 -- Relationship to Person 1

Activities of daily living
Questions 7 and 8 provide information on the number of people in Canada whose activities are reduced because of a physical condition, a mental condition, or a health problem. The answers are used to find out more about the barriers these persons face in their everyday lives.
Question 7 -- Difficulties with daily activities
Question 8 -- Reduction in activities due to physical or mental conditions or health problems
These questions refer to conditions or health problems that have lasted or are expected to last six months or more.
For young children, include only those conditions or problems that have been diagnosed by a professional.

General information
Questions 9 through 22 provide a social and cultural picture of Canada's population. Question 9 asks the province or territory in Canada, or the country outside Canada, where people were born. This information tells us about population movements within Canada, and between Canada and other countries, and provides information on the diversity of Canada's population.
Question 10 tells us the citizenship status of our population. This information helps in electoral planning; by combining it with age data, we can calculate the number of potential voters. This question also provides information used to plan citizenship classes and programs.
Questions 11 and 12 tell us the number of immigrants and non-permanent residents in Canada, and the year people immigrated to Canada. Information from these questions is often used in combination with other census data to study conditions of immigrants over time; to review immigration policies and programs; and to plan education, health, and other services.
[p. 6]
Questions 13 to 16 are used to implement programs that protect the rights of Canadians under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This information also helps to determine the need for language training and services in English or French.
Question 17 provides information about the ethnic and cultural diversity of Canada's population. This information is used to administer the Canadian Multiculturalism Act. It is also used extensively by ethnic and cultural associations, as well as by agencies and researchers, for activities such as health promotion, communications and marketing.
Questions 18, 20 and 21 provide information about Aboriginal or First Nation, Inuit and MÃ©tis peoples that is used to administer legislation and employment programs under the Indian Act of Canada and the Employment Equity Act. The information is also used by researchers and Aboriginal governments and associations to explore a wide variety of
demographic and socio-economic issues.
Question 19 tells us about the groups that make up the visible minority population in Canada. This information is required for programs under the Employment Equity Act, which promotes equal opportunity for everyone.
Question 22 provides information on religion and is used to assess the need and potential for separate religious schools in some provinces. In addition, federal and provincial human rights legislation depend on this information to protect Canadians from discrimination based on their religious beliefs.

Question 9 -- Place of birth
For persons born in an area of Canada that was formerly part of the Northwest Territories at the time of their birth but which is now a part of Nunavut, report Nunavut.

[p. 7]
Question 10 -- Citizenship
Mark Canada, by birth for persons: born in Canada (see exception below); born outside Canada, if at the time of their birth one or both parents were Canadian citizens and if this person has retained Canadian citizenship.
Exception: Some persons who are born in Canada should not mark Canada, by birth, if at the time of their birth: one or both parents were government representatives of another country (diplomatic service); and neither parent was a Canadian citizen or a landed immigrant. Mark Canada, by naturalization for persons who have become Canadian citizens. These persons have been issued a Canadian citizenship certificate. This includes persons born in the United Kingdom or in other Commonwealth countries who have immigrated to Canada and have become Canadian citizens.
For persons who were born outside Canada and have not become Canadian citizens, report under Other country the name of the other country or countries for which they hold citizenship(s).
For persons who are dual citizens of Canada and another country, do not report "dual citizenship". Mark either Canada, by birth or Canada by naturalization, and report the name of the other country.

Question 11 -- Landed immigrant status
Mark No for persons who are: Canadian citizens by birth; foreign students, foreign workers, Minister's permit holders, or refugee claimants.
Mark Yes for persons who are: Canadian citizens by naturalization; permanent residents under the Immigration Act. Permanent residents have been granted the right to live permanently in Canada by immigration authorities but have not yet obtained Canadian citizenship.

[p. 9]
Question 17 -- Ethnic origin
This question refers to the ethnic or cultural origins of a person's ancestors. An ancestor is someone from whom a person is descended and is usually more distant than a grandparent. Other than Aboriginal persons, most people can trace their origins to their ancestors who first came to this continent. Ancestry should not be confused with citizenship or nationality.
For all persons, report the specific ethnic or cultural group or groups to which their ancestors belonged, not the language they spoke. For example, report "Haitian" rather than "French", or "Austrian" rather than "German."
For persons of East Indian or South Asian origins, report a specific group. Do not report "Indian". For example, report "East Indian from India", "East Indian from Guyana", or indicate the specific group, such as "Punjabi" or "Tamil."
For persons with Aboriginal ancestors, report a specific group. For example, report "Cree", "Micmac", "Ojibway", "North American Indian," "MÃ©tis". Do not report "Indian."

Question 18 -- Aboriginal self-reporting
Answer this question regardless of whether or not this person is an Aboriginal person of North America.
Aboriginal people are usually those with ancestors who resided in North America prior to European contact and who identify with one of the three Aboriginal groups listed on the questionnaire.
Persons who consider themselves to be East Indian or Asian Indian, or who have ethnic roots on the subcontinent of India, would normally respond No to this question.
Individuals who refer to themselves as MÃ©tis in the context of mixed ancestry but who do not have North American Aboriginal ancestry--for example, those from Africa, the Caribbean and South America--would normally respond No.

Question 19 -- Population group
Population group should not be confused with citizenship or nationality.
For persons who belong to more than one group, mark all the circles that apply. Do not report "bi-racial" or "mixed" in the box provided.

Question 20 -- Indian Band/First Nation Membership
A Band is a group of First Nation people for whom lands have been set apart and money is held by the Crown. A Band member is an individual who is recognized as being a member of a Band under membership as defined by either the Band itself or the Indian Act of Canada. Individuals should report their Band/First Nation affiliation rather than their Tribal affiliation (for example, "Chemawawin First Nation Band" instead of "Cree").

[p. 10]
Question 21 -- Treaty/Registered Indian
Mark Yes for persons who: are registered as Indians under the Indian Act; are Treaty Indians, only if they are registered as Indians under the Indian Act; or have become registered as Indians since June 1985 when Bill C-31changed the Indian Act.
All other persons should mark No, including persons who may be entitled to register under provisions of the Indian Act, but for some reason have not.

Question 22 -- Religion
Report a specific group or denomination, even if the person is not practicing (for example, report "United Church", not "Protestant").
For infants or children, report the specific group or denomination in which they will be raised.
For persons who have no connection or affiliation with any religious group or denomination, mark No religion. Report "atheist" or "agnostic" if applicable.

Question 23Only respondents born before May 15, 1986 should answer Questions 24 to 51.

Mobility
Questions 24 and 25 tell us where people living in Canada are moving to and from, both within and outside Canada. This information is used to help estimate the population between censuses at the national, provincial and regional levels. It is also used to identify future needs for housing, education, transportation and social services, and contributes to programs administered under the Fiscal Arrangements Act.

Question 24 -- Place of residence 1 year ago
If the address has changed simply because the boundary or the name of the municipality or reserve/settlement has changed, mark circle 01 (Lived at the same address as now).
For persons who lived in a different city, town, village, township, municipality or Indian reserve in Canada on May 15, 2000: mark that circle and print the name of the city, town, village, township, municipality or Indian reserve, and print the name of the province or territory, and print the postal code.

Education
Questions 26 to 31 tell us about the education and training of people living in Canada about and their job skills. Governments and employers use this information to evaluate whether there are enough people with the required education, training and job skills in particular areas of the workforce. They are then able to develop training programs that meet the changing needs of our labour market.
Question 29, which provides information on school attendance, is needed for planning and financing postsecondary and adult education programs under the Canada Student Loans Act. It is also used to develop incentives and programs that help people remain in school or return to school.

Question 26 -- Highest level of elementary or secondary schooling
In the box provided, report the highest grade or level ever attended according to the province or territory where this person attended school, even if this person now lives in a different province or territory.

Labour market activities
[Questions 34 to 50 collect information on paid work done by people aged 15 and older.]
Questions 34 to 50 collect information on paid work done by people aged 15 and older.

Income
Question 51 provides the only source of detailed income statistics for all people in Canada, their families and households. Income tax records neither cover all people nor do they provide some important information on the characteristics of persons with income.
Governments use income statistics to develop income support programs and social services, such as Old Age Security Pension, provincial income supplements, social assistance, and welfare payments. They also use these statistics to ensure that programs supplementing family incomes do so efficiently and to identify specific geographic areas that need assistance.
Businesses, large and small, use these statistics to locate stores near consumers and to develop new products and services.
Personal or identifiable information is never sold or given to mailing lists. No one, including government departments, has access to income or other personal information collected in the census. All your answers are kept confidential. This is the law.

Step F: Housing
Questions H1 to H8 provide information for government planners and private developers to develop housing communities and projects. This information contributes to many programs administered under the National Housing Act and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act.
Information on the number of rooms and bedrooms in homes and on housing costs is combined with data on the number of persons in households to assess the economic situation of families in different regions. Provincial and municipal governments use this information to measure levels of crowding within households and to develop appropriate housing programs.
Information on the age of dwellings and their need for repairs is used by municipalities to develop neighborhood improvement programs.

[P. 29]

Question H1 -- Who pays
No further instructions.

Question H2 -- Owned or rented
Mark Owned if you and /or another member of this household own the dwelling in which you live, even if the dwelling is on rented or leased land, or if it is part of a condominium.
Mark Rented in all other cases, even if: the dwelling you occupy is provided without cash rent or at a reduced rent (for example, a minister's residence or superintendent's dwelling in an apartment building); the dwelling is part of a co-operative.

Question H3 -- Number of rooms and bedrooms
Part (a) -- Number of rooms in dwelling
Do not count any half-rooms (for example, instead of 1 1/2, enter either 1 or 2, depending on which best describes the dwelling).
If a room is partially divided by a fixed or movable partition, or has two parts used for different purposes such as an L-shaped living and dining room, count it as two separate rooms.
Part (b) -- Number of bedrooms
Include all rooms designated and furnished as bedrooms and used primarily for sleeping, even if only used occasionally (for example, a spare or guest bedroom).
Do not include any room used for another purpose during the day and as a bedroom at night (for example, a living room that is used as a bedroom at night).
If no rooms are used primarily for sleeping, report zero.
For a one-room dwelling or bachelor apartment, report zero.
Question H4 -- Period when built
To find out the age of the building in which you live: ask the manager or superintendent in condominiums, large apartment blocks, or other rented dwellings; check your home insurance policies and documents about the purchase of the dwelling; if a dwelling was constructed in 1961 and remodelled in 1999, mark the circle 1961-1970, not 1996-2001.

[p. 30]
Question H5 -- Need for repairs
Regular maintenance means the normal activities continually being performed to prevent the dwelling from deteriorating, such as oiling hinges and replacing electrical fuses.
If some part of your dwelling is damaged, defective or not operating properly, mark minor repairs or major repairs. Choose major repairs if your dwelling needs repairs to structures such as walls, floors, ceilings, or needs major replacements such as a new roof or new external siding.
If your dwelling needs both minor and major repairs, mark only major repairs. Do not mark both circles.

Question H6 -- Yearly payments
Parts (a) to (c)
If you have occupied this dwelling for less than a year, estimate and report the yearly amount based on either your payments up to this date or other available information.
For condominium owners, if electricity or other service charges are included in the condominium fee, mark included in rent or other payments.
Part (b)
To estimate the total yearly cost of fuel, find the amount of fuel you consumed during the year (liters of oil, containers of propane gas, cords of wood or tons of coal) and multiply it by the price per unit.

Question H7 -- Monthly rent
Enter the total rent paid by all household members for the dwelling you now occupy.
Include parking fees paid with rent, if any.

Question H8 -- Owner costs
Part (a)
Mortgage payments are sometimes made in other than monthly installments (for example, weekly, every three months, twice a year, or yearly). In such cases, add all the payments made in the last 12 months and divide the total by 12 to obtain the average monthly payment.
Part (b)
If only municipal property taxes, but not school taxes, are included in the regular monthly mortgage payments reported in part (a), mark No in part (b) and report in part (c) the amount of yearly school taxes.
[p. 31]
Part (c)
Property taxes include local improvement taxes, even if they are billed separately.
Part (d)
If this is a single dwelling, report the value of the entire property, including the land and any other detached structure on the property such as a garage.
If this dwelling is in a building that contains several dwellings, or includes both residential and business premises, estimate the portion of the market value that applies only to the dwelling in which you live.
Part (e)
Include as condominiums those dwellings that are in the process of becoming registered condominiums.
Part (f)
Condominium fees are sometimes paid in other than monthly installments. In such a case, add all payments made in the last 12 months and then divide the total by 12 to calculate the average monthly payment.
