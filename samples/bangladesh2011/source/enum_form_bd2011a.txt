Also, people engaged in night duty or in a transient state will be counted as a separate household.

Method of enumeration by using enumeration area map: number houses by starting enumeration from the north-west corner of the enumeration area and continue counting the households to your right in a serpentine way. In this case, the serial number of the first household will be 0 0 1 and that of the second household will be 0 0 2, etc.

Example: two pages must be filled out for a household of 13 members. In this case write continuation pages 0 2 page 0 1 for first page and continuation pages 0 2 page 0 2 for second page. In the same way three pages are to be filled in for household of 26 members.
In this case, write and continuation pages 0 3 page 0 1 for first page, and continuation pages
0 3 page 0 2 for second page and continuation pages 0 3 page 0 3 for the third page.

Q4. Type of household: if the housing unit is used for residential purposes only then put x inside the general box. If it is used for jailkhana, orphanage, hostel, hospital, clinic, or barrack, then put x inside institutional box and else put x inside others box.

Q5. Number of house: number of independent houses (living house, kitchen, granary, cow shed etc.) used by a household is to be written clearly in English digit in the blank box. For a household, if there are 3 independent structures write 3 inside the box. If a structure has more than 1 household, then write 9 for the last household and 0 for the other household(s).

For questions 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11a put x in the relevant box.

Q11. In case of a tribal household: find the code for the community mentioned by the respondent on the back page of the tally sheet and write it clearly using English digits inside the blank box.

Write the name of spouse in the second line, youngest child in the third line, then other children, other relatives and non-relatives.

Using this code list write appropriate code to the blank boxes for the highest class passed by each member of the household. If someone did not go to school, then the highest class passed code will be 0 0. If someone is ssc passed then highest class passed code will be 1 0. If someone has higher degree than masters then code will be 1 8.
