INSTRUCTION
Assalamualikum

(At the beginning the zonal officer will take the attendance of the Enumerators and Supervisors)
I welcome you all in the training class of Population and Housing Census 2011. You might be aware that the up coming Fifth Population and Housing Census will be conducted in the country during 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 March, 2011 in five days which are Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday respectively. To conduct the census all the mahallahs in the urban area and all the villages in the rural area have been divided into one or more enumeration areas. For each and every enumeration area a map has been prepared and easily identifiable roads, canals, rivers, ponds, ditch, mosque, temple, school, college, madrasa etc. have been shown in the map as land mark around the map and name of Household/ Educational Institutions have also been used as legend. The enumeration areas (EA) have been constituted with more or less 120 households and to enumerate the household, housing structures and individuals one enumerator has been appointment for each E.A. You gentleman who will work as enumerator and how you will perform the duties of enumeration perfectly visiting door to door all these things will bring out before you in this training class. In order to complete the enumeration accurately one supervisor has been appointed to supervise 6/7 enumerators so that none is left and none is counted twice in the census. The supervisors are also taking training with you in this training class. For each supervisor on Supervisor's Area Map has also been prepared. In the supervisor's map name of road, canal, river, ditch, pond, mosque, temple, school, college, madrasa, household head/institution etc. have been mentioned as legend. In this census every supervisor will work along with his enumerators as a team.
Now, I like to exchange my views with you on the fundamental six points on census and the training schedule.
1. Questionnaire: The first instrument in the census is questionnaire where the collected information will be entered. A questionnaire has been designed for Population and Housing Census 2011 where collected information will be entered. All of you look at the questionnaire. It has been formulated in such a way so that ICR machine can capture the data.

2. ICR: The abbreviation of ICR is Intelligent Character Recognition Machine. It is a modern OCR machine, The information written and entered in the questionnaire (such as 1, 2, 3) alphabet (such as B.T.D) and cross (() is directly possible to be captured in this machine.

3. Enumeration Area: It has been made sure after analyzing the past experience and verifying the field of work that within five days enumeration of 120 households is possible. Keeping this idea in view all the villages in the rural area and mahallahs in the urban area have been divided to constitute an enumeration area having more or less 120 households and enumerator has been appointment for each enumeration area.

4. Definition of Map: The physical features of the earth presented in a short paper is called map. In census map the legends like road, housing, lake, ditch, pond, river, school, college, and mosque, temple, crop field etc. land marks are shown. Maps are generally two types. (1) Scale based and (2) Non-scale based (Sketch map).

[p. 4]

In this census digital maps maintaining 1.5000 scale for urban area and 1.10000 scale for rural area have been prepared after having image from the air. In those maps identification boundary for mauza and within mauza villages and dividing villages enumeration areas have been clearly done for rural area. In urban area identification boundary for mahallah and dividing mahallah enumeration areas have been shown.

In practice it has found that identification of enumeration area boundary will not be easy due to small scaling of those maps. Considering the circumstances maps without scale i.e sketch map have been prepared to use during enumeration in the census.
Use of maps in the census to collect information and disseminate census data to the people is undoubtedly important.

5. Supervisor Area: In the census one supervisor to supervise the works of 6/7 enumerators closely and guide them to do enumeration work has been appointed. As such a supervisor area map combining 6/7 enumeration areas has also been prepared. Each and every enumeration area has been clearly identified in the supervisor's map using easily identifiable land marks a legend. Following this map the supervisors will identify the enumeration areas and handed over the responsibility of enumeration to the enumerators working under his control specifically. This map will be used in the census as a base map.

6. Training Schedule: A unique and identical verbatim training manual has been prepared to impart training to the enumerators and supervisors all over the country. A three-day long training will be imparted to you following this verbatim training manual strictly.
First Day: Use of enumeration area map will be taught and the supervisors along with the enumerators under his control will go to the field and using map enumeration area will be identified and handed over to the enumerators. If there happen any trouble to identify the enumeration area the supervisor and the enumerators will do the needful in the field and update the map using necessary landmarks as legends. If there is difficulty in the field please contact me in no time so that I can solve the problem immediately at the field.
Second Day: In the first half of the second day you will be taught in the class room how to fill out the questionnaire using the verbatim Training Manual and in the after noon session will be held on questions and answers and a mock training will also be materialized.
Third Day: On the third day of training there will be a field trip where questionnaire will be filled out in the field and coming back to the training class discussion and evaluation will be made on field experience.
At last filling out of Tally Sheet, discussion on the calendar of activities of the enumerator and supervisor and filling out the control forms will be taught.

Chapter 1
Procedure for using of Census Maps:

At the beginning I am telling you that in this census the supervisors and the enumerators should use supervisor's maps and enumerator's map respectively. The aim of using map is that the supervisors will identify the enumeration area specifically and hand over to the enumerators under his control in such a way so that nobody is left out from the census and none is counted twice. We will use supervisor's area sketch map to make it easy for the enumerator in using the maps.
We all that is I myself, zonal officers and all of you will go to field now. The duty of the supervisors is to identify the enumeration areas and hand over to the concerned enumerators under his control at the field level. If there found no identification land marks around the enumeration area the Supervisor and the Enumerators will jointly update the map using legends and from Tuesday, the 15th instant the enumerator will enumerate all the houses, households and individuals using the enumeration area map. In no how the enumerator will enumerate any body out of the jurisdiction of the map and will left out some one from the census within the jurisdiction of the map. Remember that an independent group will come to remunerate this area just after few days of completion of this work and will check the quality of your work. If there found any mistakes its responsibilities will go to you.
Before going to the field I shall discuss in brief on the supervisor's map from a rural area and another supervisor's map from an urban area to have an over all idea on it. The maps for the supervisors have been prepared based on digital maps in this census. This map contains five parts such as (1) Title (2) Scale (3) Direction (4) Body of the map and (5) Legend. We shall discuss only on sketch map.

[the supervisor's maps have been omitted]
[p. 9]

1.3 Evaluation of Field Experience
(Coming back to the training class at 3:00 pm addressing every supervisor ask questions). Did you identify the areas of all of your Enumerators? If the answer is yes then ask any of the enumerators "Tell me the land marks you find arround the EA assigned to you" (If the answer is satisfaory verify the works of next superviors and if found not satisfactory ask the supervisor to go to field again and make identifiable his EAs today. Serialy ask every supervisor and at least one of their Enumeraor).
We have reached at the end of the first day training. Still if you have any confusion to identify the boundaries of EA ask me and be clear. You might have observed that in rural area we first identified the boundaries of villages in the mauza map and within village we have identified the boundaries of the Enumeration Areas. Every Eunmerator should bring all the houses, households and individulas in to the coverage of census of his assigned EA. Similarly we have identified the enumeration area in the mahallah maps in urban area and enumerator should ensure the coverage of every house, household and individuals of his assigned EA. You have also observed that we have demarketed EA having more or less 120 households. You must bring it to the notice of the zonal officer if there found inconsistency.

From today every Supervisor and Enumerators under his control formed a census working team. You must work in the field as complementary to each other so that none is left from the census. The load of work has been incorporated in such a way that the enumerator can do his assigned day to day work within the census period. There is no scope to make arear of his work. Those who will work very sincerity and accurately, they will be awarded Testimonials which will be evaluated any where in future.
We will assemble here tomorrow at 9.00 a.m again to rceived the training of the second day.
(Thank you very much)

2.1 Important Teams and Defintions used in the census:

Household: People those who taken food from the same kitechen and stayed the census night under the same roof/house constitute a household. Household may be formed with only one member or more than one member.

Example: Mr. Shahnoor along with his spouse and two children stayed the census night in the Govt. quarter no M-606, Satodal and taken food from the same ketchen. According to the definition of census Mr. Shahnoor, his spouse and two children will form a household. In the same night Mr. Rafiqul Islam, his spouse, one children, his mother and a maid servant stayed the census night in his village home located at the village Dhanki Mohera, Post: Ar-Moista, Upazila: Delduar, Zila: Tangail and taken food from the same kitchen. According to the definition of census this is also a household.
If any member of the household is engaged with night duty or on travel/journey he/she will be enumerated in his regular household.

Head of Household: The main person or person who is accepted by the members of the household as head of the household will be considered a head of the househod.

Census Momment: The zero hour 12:00 of the census night is called the census moment. The main objective of the census is to ensure the number of structures, households and population in the country on the census moment.

Example: In March 15 to 19, 2011 the Population and Housing Census of the country will be conducted. According to the definition of census the zero hour i.e, 12:00 hour of the census night is to be considered as census Moment.

Census Night: The time from census Moment i.e 12:00 hour to 6:00 a.m of the census night is to be considered as census night. All the floating population of the country will be brought under the coverage of the census in the census night.

Floating: People those who have no house or shelter for living and usually spent night at the railway sation, bus terminal, majar, footpath, staircase/under over bridge, lanch terminal, ferigaht, open space, varanda of markets will be considered as floating population. Besides the boarders spent the census night at residential hotel or rest house will also be considered as floating. The persons on duty and travellers on the census night will not be considered as floating, they will be enumerated in their respective households.

[p. 11]

Procedure of the Census: The census of 2011 will be conducted following the modified De-facto system. According to this system persons will be enumerated at the household or place where they spent the census night or will be enumerated as floating population of that place. In the census night if there is any guest or servant in the household and spent census night with the household they will be considered as a member of that household. Besides, the persons will be on duty in the census night (such as- Census workers, person on night duty in the office/institution, attendents of patients in the Hospital and doctor on night duty, security personel etc.) and travelers in the transport will be enumerated in their respective households. If anybody died before the census moment or any baby born after census moment will not be included in the census.
